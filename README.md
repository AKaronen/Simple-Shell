# HT3

A simple Linux commandline interpreter (basically a shell) with two modes, interactive-mode and batch-mode. With interactive-mode, user can use it like a typical terminal shell. With batch-mode the shell interprets it's commands from a text-file given as a input. There are also built-in commands such as cd, path and exit. Cd works the same way as in other shells, path is for choosing the used shell path and exit is for... you know, exitting.
